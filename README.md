# Huffman-String-Compression-and-Decompression-Algorithm
This project is about using huffman tree to make a data compression and decompression algorithm for an input string from the user it compresses the input string and decompress it using c++ made in my second year of university in Data Structure And Algorithm course.

# 🔢 Huffman Compression & Decompression in C++

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements **Huffman Encoding and Decoding** in C++. It compresses text by encoding characters into binary codes based on their frequency, reducing storage size. It then decompresses the data back to its original form.

## 📂 Features  
✅ **Character Frequency Analysis**: Counts occurrences of each character  
✅ **Huffman Tree Construction**: Builds a binary tree for encoding  
✅ **Compression**: Encodes input text into a compact binary representation  
✅ **Decompression**: Restores original text from compressed data

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Counts character frequencies** in the input text  
2. **Builds a Huffman tree** using a priority queue  
3. **Generates Huffman codes** for each character  
4. **Encodes the input** into a compressed binary form  
5. **Decodes the compressed data** back into the original text
