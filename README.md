# Huffman-String-Compression-and-Decompression-Algorithm
This project is about using huffman tree to make a data compression and decompression algorithm for an input string from the user it compresses the input string and decompress it using c++ made in my second year of university in Data Structure And Algorithm course.


Huffman Compression & Decompression in C++
📌 Overview
This project implements Huffman Encoding and Decoding in C++. It efficiently compresses text by converting characters into binary codes based on frequency and then decompresses the encoded data back to its original form.

📂 Features
✅ Frequency Calculation: Counts character occurrences in the input text
✅ Huffman Tree Construction: Uses a priority queue to create a binary tree
✅ Compression: Encodes input text using Huffman codes
✅ Decompression: Restores original text from compressed data

⚙️ How It Works
Character frequency analysis
Builds a Huffman tree using a linked list
Generates Huffman codes for each character
Compresses input text into binary form
Decodes the binary data back into text
🛠️ Installation & Usage
🔹 Prerequisites
C++ Compiler (G++, Clang, MinGW, or Visual Studio)
